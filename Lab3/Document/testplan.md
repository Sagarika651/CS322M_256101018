Test Plan (TESTPLAN.md)

This test plan documents the input register values and expected outputs for each RVX10 operation used in the test image.
Common initial registers

    After addi x1, x0, 5 -> x1 = 5 (0x00000005)
    After addi x2, x0, 3 -> x2 = 3 (0x00000003)

We then run each custom instruction and record expected rd values.
ANDN x3, x1, x2

    Operation: rd = rs1 & ~rs2
    Inputs: x1 = 5, x2 = 3
    Calculation: ~3 = 0xFFFFFFFC; 5 & 0xFFFFFFFC = 4
    Expected: x3 = 4 (0x00000004)

ORN x4, x1, x2

    Operation: rd = rs1 | ~rs2
    Inputs: x1 = 5, x2 = 3
    Calculation: 5 | 0xFFFFFFFC = 0xFFFFFFFD
    Expected: x4 = 0xFFFFFFFD (signed: -3)

XNOR x6, x1, x2

    Operation: rd = ~(rs1 ^ rs2)
    Inputs: x1 = 5, x2 = 3 -> 5 ^ 3 = 6 -> ~6 = 0xFFFFFFF9
    Expected: x6 = 0xFFFFFFF9

MIN x7, x1, x2 (signed)

    Inputs: 5 and 3
    Expected: x7 = 3

MAX x8, x2, x1 (signed)

    Inputs (note order): rs1 = x2 = 3, rs2 = x1 = 5
    Expected: x8 = 5

MINU x9, x2, x1 (unsigned)

    Inputs: 3 and 5 => unsigned min = 3
    Expected: x9 = 3

MAXU x10, x2, x1 (unsigned)

    Expected: x10 = 5

ROL x11, x1, x2

    Operation: rotate-left a by b[4:0]
    Inputs: a = 5 (0x5), shift = 3
    Expected: 0x5 rol 3 = 0x28 (40)

ROR x12, x1, x2

    Operation: rotate-right a by b[4:0]
    Inputs: a = 5, shift = 3
    Expected: (5 >> 3) | (5 << 29) = 0xA0000000

ABS x14, x1, x0 (rs2 = x0)

    Operation: absolute value of x1 (signed)
    Input: x1 = 5
    Expected: x14 = 5

Final store to signal success

    addi x5, x0, 25 sets x5 = 25
    sw x5, 100(x0) stores 25 into memory address 100.
    Testbench checks for DataAdr === 100 and WriteData === 25 and prints "Simulation succeeded".

Edge cases (to test if you expand tests later)

    ROL/ROR with shamt = 0 -> should return operand unchanged.
    ABS on INT_MIN (0x80000000) -> result should remain 0x80000000 (wrap-around)
    Signed vs unsigned MIN/MAX where values cross sign boundary
